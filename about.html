  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>Dosdows Was founded in 2016</p>
  <p>Dosdows then later went on to editing the Windows Operating system into a better version of the software.</p>
  <p>However, due to limitations and legal issues, this plan was also scrapped.</p>
  <p>Dosdows was left untouched for a few months until we came up with the idea for an application built by us called DosDOWS</p>
  <p>When the most earliest builds were released, it was nothing, nothing worked and it could only make a text file that didnt look all that well.</p>
  <p>DosDOWS then later went on to become a really good peice of software... until later on. There was an equipment failure and all files related to DosDOWS were deleted.</p>
  <p>The project before hand was too messed up anyways so it wasnt really a big deal. (There are still DosDOWS versions left before the system failure caled DosDOWS BR)</p>
  <p>That brings us to today. We are still working on many projects that we cant wait to show you. For more info about Dosdows, please contact us.</p>
